# Overview

This is a Higher or Lower minigame using the Java language. It prompts the user to predict if their number will be higher or lower than the cpu's number by having them enter the letter "h" for higher or "l" for lower. If they try to enter anything else, it will just keep repeating the question until they enter either "h" or "l".
Then it reveals what random number between 1-15 was generated for both the player and the cpu and tells if the player won, tied, or lost. The loop keeps going until the player loses, and then it prints out the total wins and ties the player got before losing to the cpu.

I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Java integrated together. While also having something fun to mess with.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
- Visual Studio Code
- Java Programming Language
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Extension Pack for Java in VS Code
- Git & GitHub

In order to use Java in Visual Studio Code to enjoy the full potential of the programming language, it's a good idea to install the Extension Pack for Java by searching "Java" in the Extensions Marketplace. It should be the first extension that pops up on the list.

Important: You will need to download a Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java to run within Visual Studio Code!

# Future Work

- Make the loop work where a tie just has you re-roll and not start the loop over from the beginning.
